                                <li>Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure that each question and its corresponding options are clear and concise. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.</li>
                                <li>Single Best Answer: Each MCQ should ideally have only one correct answer. Avoid questions where more than one option may seem correct or where none of the options are correct.</li>
                                <li>Avoid Negative Wording: Try to avoid negatively worded questions (e.g., "Which of the following is NOT..."). They can confuse test-takers and increase the chance of misinterpretation.</li>
                                <li>Avoid Absolute Terms: Be cautious with using absolute terms like "always," "never," "completely," etc., in both questions and options, as there may be exceptions that invalidate the statement.</li>
                                <li>Randomization: If possible, randomize the order of options to prevent test-takers from relying solely on position-based cues.</li>
                                <li>Avoid Trivial Questions: Ensure that the questions assess meaningful understanding of the topic and avoid including questions that are too easy or too obscure.</li>
                                <li>Review and Revision: Always review and revise your MCQs before using them in assessments. Get feedback from peers or subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and fairness.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Clear Problem Statement: Provide a clear and concise problem statement that outlines the task or problem the participant needs to solve. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and frustration.</li>
                                <li>Define Input and Output: Clearly specify the input format, constraints, and expected output for the problem. Understanding the input-output behavior helps participants formulate their solutions effectively.</li>
                                <li>Example Cases: Include example cases to illustrate how the solution should behave under different inputs. Example cases provide clarity and serve as a guide for participants.</li>
                                <li>Test Cases: Provide a set of test cases to validate the correctness and efficiency of the participants' solutions. Test cases should cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases and corner cases.                                </li>
                                <li>Time and Space Complexity: Encourage participants to consider the time and space complexity of their solutions. Emphasize the importance of writing efficient code that performs well under different input sizes.</li>
                                <li>Feedback Mechanism: Offer a feedback mechanism where participants can test their solutions against provided test cases and receive immediate feedback on correctness and performance.</li>
                                <li>Continuous Improvement: Gather feedback from participants and iterate on the challenges based on their experiences and suggestions. Continuous improvement ensures that the challenges remain relevant and engaging over time.</li>
